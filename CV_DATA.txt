Software-developer skilled in Python and JavaScript focused on Applied Machine Learning and Web/App Design

Experience in training AI models, building full-stack websites, data analysis (AI enhanced).

Methodical and analytical, hard-working and efficient, fast-learning, hungry for excellence and passionate about bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.


EXPERIENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine Learning Engineer
BabyClue · Part-time
Nov 2024 - Present

Built and evaluated a multi-class infant-cry classification pipeline, focusing on robust validation, interpretability, and reproducibility.

• Developed end-to-end ML evaluation workflows in Python
• Ran rigorous, comparative model testing using nested CV with fold-level and aggregated analysis (macro/micro F1, per-class precision/recall/F1, confusion matrices, latency) to reliably determine which approaches generalized best across splits
• Built the full training pipeline combining audio preprocessing (spectrogram-based features / AST embeddings), data augmentation, feature construction (late-fusion of embedding + acoustic features), and model training/inference across multiple model families (e.g., MLP, LightGBM, plus classical baselines like SVM/Nearest Centroid where applicable)

Skills: Machine Learning, Data-Centric AI, Hyperparameter Optimization
